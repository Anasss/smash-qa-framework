# ðŸš€ smash-qa-framework

End-to-end Playwright + TypeScript tests for Smashburgerâ€™s web ordering flow. The framework uses a clean Page Object Model (POM) design, data-driven scenarios, fast and semantic locators, and includes pragmatic helpers for test stability, performance, and maintainability.

## âš¡ Quick start

1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anasss/smash-qa-framework

```

3) View report (after a run)

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## ðŸ§° Whatâ€™s inside

- pages/ â€” Page Objects (catalog, store-locator, product, cart, checkout, order-confirmation)

- fixtures/ â€” Pages and flows fixtures (bootstrap pickup, go to Create Your Own)
